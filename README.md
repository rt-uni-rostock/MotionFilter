| MotionFilter3DoF | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | Estimates disturbance-free motion and external force for a surface vehicle. |


## How To Use
To use the toolbox, add the `MotionFilter.prj` project file as reference project to your own simulink project.
This will add the `library` and `packages` directories to your project path automatically.
For examples, take a look to the [examples](examples/) directory.
